# Welcome to my useless github profile

Really, there's nothing useful here right now. I have no time and energy to actually develop anything significant.

Maybe one day...

For now I mostly use github to report and discuss bugs and whatnot, and the occasional personal script that might help someone someday.

### If I somehow helped you and you wanna thank me, consider sending a dollar or so my way, because I'm broke af right now:
